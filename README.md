# 🎲 BoardGame SQLite: Your Game Board, Persisted!

Welcome to **BoardGame SQLite**, the ultimate Python library for crafting 2D game boards that stick around like a well-played chess move! 🧩 Whether you’re building a strategy game, a dungeon crawler, or a digital Risk clone, this library lets you manage a board with attributes (think tanks, health points, or sneaky rogues) and saves it all to SQLite—because no one likes losing their game state. With a rock-solid test suite, you’re ready to roll the dice! 🎯

## 🌟 Why You’ll Love It

Imagine your game board as a battlefield: every square holds troops, treasures, or traps. **BoardGame SQLite** is your trusty general, letting you:
- 🗺️ **Command a 2D Board**: Set up an n x n grid and assign attributes like `unit: tank` or `health: 5`.
- 💾 **Persist Like a Pro**: Save your board state to SQLite, in-memory for testing or file-based for epic campaigns.
- 🧑‍💻 **Code with Confidence**: 8 unit tests cover every move, from initialization to persistence.
- 🚀 **Get Started Fast**: No dependencies, just pure Python magic.

Whether you’re a hobbyist coder or a game dev wizard, this library is your shortcut to building robust game mechanics without sweating the storage details. Let’s dive in! ⚔️

## 🎮 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.6+ (because who’s still on 2.x?)
- 📦 SQLite (comes with Python’s `sqlite3` module)

### Installation
1. Clone this repo like you’re capturing a flag:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/boardgame-sqlite.git
   cd boardgame-sqlite
   ```
2. That’s it! No `pip install` nonsense—pure Python standard library goodness.

### Play Your First Move
Here’s how to set up a 5x5 board and deploy a tank:

```python
from board_game import BoardGame

# Create a 5x5 board with a file-based SQLite database
game = BoardGame(size=5, db_name="battle.db")

# Deploy a tank at (2, 3)
game.set_position(2, 3, [["unit", "tank"], ["health", 5]])
print(game.get_position(2, 3))  # [['unit', 'tank'], ['health', 5]]

# Heal the tank
game.update_attribute(2, 3, "health", 10)
print(game.get_position(2, 3))  # [['unit', 'tank'], ['health', 10]]

# Clear the position
game.remove_position(2, 3)
print(game.get_position(2, 3))  # None

# Save and close
game.close()
```

Run this, and your board state is safely tucked away in `battle.db`. Reload it later, and your tank’s ready for round two! 🛡️

## 🧪 Test It Like a Boss

The included test suite (`TestBoardGame.py`) is your quality assurance squad, with 8 tests covering every angle:

- `test_init`: Ensures your board starts fresh.
- `test_validate_coord`: Keeps moves within bounds.
- `test_set_position`: Sets and overwrites attributes.
- `test_get_position`: Retrieves your game pieces.
- `test_update_attribute`: Updates or adds attributes.
- `test_remove_position`: Clears the battlefield.
- `test_get_board_state`: Grabs the full board state (safely copied).
- `test_persistence`: Confirms SQLite saves your game.

Run the tests:
```bash
python3 TestBoardGame.py
```

Expect a victory lap:
```
=== Setting up test ===
Testing __init__
  __init__: Size and empty board - PASSED
...
Testing persistence
  persistence: File-based persistence - PASSED
Ran 8 tests in 0.005s
OK
```

## 🛠️ Features That Pack a Punch

- **Flexible Board Management** 📍: Handle any n x n grid with sparse storage (only occupied positions are stored).
- **SQLite Superpowers** 💽: Toggle between in-memory (`:memory:`) for tests and file-based (e.g., `game.db`) for persistence.
- **Attribute Awesomeness** 🏰: Store key-value pairs (e.g., `[['unit', 'soldier'], ['health', 10]]`) at any position.
- **Robust Validation** 🔍: Coordinate checks prevent off-board shenanigans.
- **Test-Driven Glory** 🏆: 100% test coverage ensures your game logic is bulletproof.

## 📂 What’s in the Box?

```
boardgame-sqlite/
├── README.md          📜 Your guide to glory
├── board_game.py      🕹️ The BoardGame class with SQLite magic
├── TestBoardGame.py   🧪 Tests (with embedded BoardGame for sandbox compatibility)
├── header.txt         📄 Empty placeholder (future docs?)
├── footer.txt         📄 Empty placeholder (more to come?)
├── additional.txt     📄 Empty placeholder (room for extras)
```

- **`board_game.py`**: The standalone `BoardGame` class, ready for production.
- **`TestBoardGame.py`**: Unit tests with an embedded `BoardGame` class to dodge import issues in sandboxes like Grok.com.
- **`header.txt`, `footer.txt`, `additional.txt`**: Empty files, waiting for your creative touch (game rules, metadata, or ASCII art?).

## 💡 Pro Tips for Devs

- **Extend Attributes**: Add complex attributes (e.g., nested lists) by tweaking the JSON serialization in `board_game.py`.
- **Scale Up**: Test with large boards (e.g., `size=1000`) to stress-test SQLite performance.
- **Add Transactions**: Wrap SQLite operations in `BEGIN TRANSACTION` for atomic updates in multiplayer games.
- **Visualize It**: Pair with a library like `matplotlib` to plot your board state. Want a heatmap of occupied positions? Ping me!
- **Cleanup**: The test suite auto-deletes `test_board.db`, but keep an eye on file-based DBs in production.
